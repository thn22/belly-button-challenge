## Description of the Project
For this project, I was tasked to build an interactive dashboard for the Belly Button Biodiversity data set [linked here](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/). This dataset displays that a few species of microbes are actively present in more than 70% of people while others are fairly rare. The dashboard displays this information. 


## Languages and Libraries
This project used Javascript, CSS, and HTML.
